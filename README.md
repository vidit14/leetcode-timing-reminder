# ⏱️ LeetCode Timer Reminder

A simple Chrome extension that **reminds you to start the timer** every time you open a LeetCode problem.

## 🧠 Why?

When you're solving problems for practice, it's easy to **dive in too fast** — reading and thinking before you remember to start the timer.  
This ruins the point of timing yourself like in a real interview or contest.

> This extension ensures you **don't forget to start your timer** — by gently reminding you when the problem page loads.
